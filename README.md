#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFZ0JYVgmDU
#### Description:

Introduction: Website "Parallel Lines & Madhubani" is my final project for CS50's - Introduction to computer science. This is a dynamic website developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScripit and Flask. Static version of this website is hosted on github at https://neelima23saraf.github.io/plnm/

Description: I practice Madhubani art and needed a platform where I can showcase my art works. With the help of this website I can do the same.

We need Flask to be installed in order this website to work. Home,  About and My works pages are the static pages. They are developed using HTML, CSS using Bootstrap 5 framework. This website uses fontawesome icons. Photo gallery in the My works page is inspired from  https://epicbootstrap.com/snippets/lightbox-gallery.
Contact page is dynamic page.  We need Environment variable (to store password ) to be set up in order for mail functionality to work. However due to privacy concern I cannot setup my password in the CS50 IDE, hence this functionality will not work in the IDE.

-> Home/Index: This page describes about my journey as an artist. I always had an inclination towards the art, but did not know where to start or never had time to think about it. This page describes what inspired me to do so. User can click on Facebook and Instagram icon on the top right corner of the banner to reach respective pages 

-> About: Madhubai art is one of the oldest folk art from India. About page has details about the Madhubani folk art and the artist. User can further click on the Know more button and they will be redirectd to respective Wiki pages.

-> My Works: Madhunai art basically describe an object living/no living or a scene through parallel lines and intricate design, which are often filled with bright colors. 
My Works section is a photo gallery which is further categorized as:

-> Contact - In case if anyone wants to know more about my art work they can contact me using Contact form. This is a dynamic page. Users have to fill User name and email ID (these two are mandatory) and message and click on Connect. A mail will be sent on my gmail account and I can contact user further.

Overall look of the webite is muted(dull) so as to brighten up the bright colors of the paintings.  

I started CS50 project as it was prerequisite for one of the other project, but I ended up building my own website. I could not be more thankful to EDX, Harvard and Prof. David J Malan for making such a wonderful course and giving everyone equal opportunity to learn and code.
